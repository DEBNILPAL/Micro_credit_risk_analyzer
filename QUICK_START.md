## How to Connect the Backend (3 Easy Steps)

### Option 1: One-Click Start (Recommended)
1. **Double-click** `start_backend_simple.bat` in the project root folder
2. Wait for "Server will be available at: http://localhost:8000" message
3. Open your frontend application - it will automatically connect!

### Option 2: Manual Start
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\debni\Downloads\Micro_credit_risk_analyzer"
   ```
3. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   start_backend_simple.bat
   ```

### Option 3: Python Direct
1. Open Command Prompt in the `backend` folder
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_simple.txt
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python simple_main.py
   ```

## âœ… How to Know It's Working

- **Backend Status**: Look for "Backend Connected" ðŸŸ¢ indicator in the frontend
- **Server URL**: Backend runs at `http://localhost:8000`

- **Health Check**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/health`

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "Backend Disconnected" Error
